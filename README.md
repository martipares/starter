# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Modified template for LazyVim by martipares.
With a selection of extras to enable by default, 
some plugins with additional configuration, snippets and spell.

This template has been modified to source LazyVim from my fork
for testing purpose.
